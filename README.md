# Home Camera

**Thereâ€™s no better security system than the one you build yourself!**

## Project Overview
Home camera is a mobile application that connects to the HikVision Camera connected to the Wifi of a household. The application allows its users to view the cameras from any room of the house without having to be in the same room as the main camera

This is a personal project focused on practicing skills i picked up from a Google UX Specialisation course I complied. I also wanted an opportunity to practice my mobile application skills, and work on a project with video

## Application Description
**Home Camera** is a personal project focused on creating a mobile app that connects to home security cameras. The goal of this app is to provide a simple and intuitive way to remotely monitor cameras connected to the homeâ€™s WiFi network. The project is aimed at enhancing my UX design skills and combining them with hands-on coding experience, especially in working with video streaming.

While there are plenty of apps in the market that provide similar functionalities, this project focuses on developing a tailored solution for personal use, leveraging the design and development knowledge gained from the Google UX Design Specialization on Coursera.

## User Persona

Kweku is a Computer Science major at Ashesi University, graduating about a year ago. He loves everything tech, frequently dabbling in arduino projects and software development. He enjoys moding electronics around him to adapt them to his specific lifestyle. More recently, Kweku travels very often and wants a way to check in with his home security while on the road

## User Story

> As a security-conscious, tech-literate user, I want to be able to remotely check the cameras in my house so that I can be aware of activities on the premises.

## Project Requirements
![Requirements](assets/readme/application_requirements.png)

Based on the user persona, the following project requirements were identified:
Based on the user persona, the following primary functionality were identified

1. **Remote Connectivity:** Users should be able to view all the cameras connected to their WiFi.
2. **Event Subscription:** Users should be able to subscribe to specific events or activities (e.g., motion detection).
3. **Default View Configuration:** Users should be able to set a default view on the homepage for quick access.

### Full functionality list

- [x] Viewing of all connected cameras on the local network
- [ ] Triggering of custom events with selected cameras (person walking into frame, etc)
- [ ] Changing the arrangement of cameras in the camera grid of the application
- [ ] Customizing the names of cameras on the application
- [ ] Ability to playback video feed from specific custom events


## Design Process

### 1. **Research and Inspiration**
Taking design inspiration from apps available on the Google Play Store and design platforms like **Dribbble**, the project emphasizes a clean, minimalist interface with a focus on usability and functionality.

### 2. **Wireframing**
I began the design phase by creating wireframes. The focus was on arranging the key elements, like camera feeds, event alerts, and navigation.

### 3. **Prototyping**
I developed a low-fidelity prototype, focusing on core interactions and layouts. This prototype helped me quickly iterate on the user experience without being bogged down by detailed visuals. The design includes a **design system** that provides consistency and helps in maintaining uniformity across the app.
